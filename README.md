Multi-Agent Market Research and Use Case Generation System

This project is a multi-agent system designed to conduct in-depth market research and generate AI/ML use cases for a target company within a specific industry. Using Google Generative AI, CrewAI, and Streamlit for an interactive user interface, this system enables quick, automated research and report generation through specialized agents.

Project Overview :

This system leverages four main agents to complete distinct tasks:

1.) Research Agent - Gathers industry insights and competitor analysis for the target company.
2.) Use Case Generation Agent - Proposes relevant AI/ML and Generative AI applications based on research findings.
3.) Resource Collection Agent - Identifies suitable datasets from platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub for suggested use cases.
4.) Report Generation Agent - Compiles all findings into a detailed report ready for decision-making.

Key Features :

1.) Automated Market Research: Collects and analyzes industry and company information.
2.) AI/ML Use Case Recommendations: Generates actionable AI/ML use cases tailored to the industry and companyâ€™s goals.
3.) Dataset Search: Locates relevant datasets to support the use cases.
4.) Report Generation: Compiles a comprehensive report, downloadable in plain text format.
5.) Streamlit Interface: Interactive web interface for easy input and real-time feedback.

Technology Stack :

1.) Python: Core programming language.
2.) Streamlit: Web framework for the UI.
3.) CrewAI: Task orchestration and agent management.
4.) Google Generative AI: Provides the underlying generative model.
5.) dotenv: Manages environment variables.
6.) SerperDevTool: Used for Google searches (optional).
7.) Installation
